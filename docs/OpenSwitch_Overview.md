# Overview

## The OpenSwitch Platform

The OpenSwitch Platform is an open source, Linux-based network operating system (NOS) platform. Built under the open source model, OpenSwitch offers the freedom of innovation while maintaining stability and limiting vulnerability.

OpenSwitch is a network operating system for disaggregated switches that are built around OCP compliant hardware and that utilizes the ONIE boot loader to install and uninstall network operating systems. It is aimed at accelerating the transition to open networking as well as the adoption of disaggregated data center networks. OpenSwitch provides a fully-featured control plane stack with support for layer 2 and layer 3 networking protocols. The NOS is built around a reliable architecture focusing on modularity and a central state repository.

OpenSwitch is an extensible NOS that utilizes modern development tools and offers extensive APIs and management interfaces.

Developers can build on the reliable and modern architecture to create unique networking features and applications using an agile development approach for faster development and more stable applications with fewer post-release defects.

## The OpenSwitch Community

The OpenSwitch community is an open community initiated by charter contributors who are offering and will continue to offer valuable contributions to the community, with the goal of advancing state of the art of open networking.

It is not a secret that the current vertically-integrated networking switches model has been frozen in time for decades and is no longer suitable for web-scale data center needs. OpenSwitch will serve as a catalyst for accelerating the move to disaggregated networking switches and enable developers and customers with the tools they need to break free from the limitations of integrated switches to take control of their networks and better serve their business needs. The OpenSwitch community is here to support and nurture the community effort, help the adoption of OpenSwitch, and facilitate the growth of a healthy OpenSwitch ecosystem of developers and users.

Charter contributors to OpenSwitch are Hewlett Packard, Accton, Broadcom, Intel, Qosmos and VMWare. You are invited to join the growing OpenSwitch community to benefit from the experiences and contributions of members, make your own contributions and help guide the OpenSwitch community.
